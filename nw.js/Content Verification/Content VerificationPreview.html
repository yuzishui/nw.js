    <p id="1"># Content Verification</p>
    <p id="2">---</p>

    <p id="4">The "content verification" feature, or "app signing", prevents loading unsigned files with your official binary. Given a keypair, 'verified_contents.json' is the signature for the application files. It's created with the tool 'sign.py' and the private key (private_key.pem file). The public key is built into NW.js binary. To run the signed application, use `nw --verify-content=enforce_strict .` in the application directory. It will show the simple page. In the next, try to modify index.html a little bit and run it again. NW will report the file is corrupted and quit immediately.</p>
    <p id="5">!!! note</p>
    <p id="6">    This feature doesn't prevent someone from hacking your app and loading it with other NW binaries. Consider writing some of your features with C++ and load it with Node.js module, NaCl or [compile your JS to binary with nwjc](Protect JavaScript Source Code.md)</p>
    <p id="7">## Sign an application</p>
    <p id="8">To sign an application with the demo keypair, do the following:</p>
    <p id="9">1. change to application directory</p>
    <p id="10">2. make sure `verified_contents.json` or `computed_hashes.json` is not there (you can just remove them)</p>
    <p id="11">3. run `payload.exe`; it will generate `payload.json`, which serves as input for `sign.py`</p>
    <p id="12">4. run `python sign.py &gt; /tmp/verified_contents.json` (it's important that the tmp destination directory is not application directory)</p>
    <p id="13">5. move the generated `verified_contents.json` file to application dir and it's done.</p>
    <p id="14">## Rebuild to use your own keypair</p>
    <p id="15">To use your own keypair you'll need to rebuild the NW binary. And the argument for `--verify-content=` in the command line need to be set to `enforce_strict` by default in your build.</p>
    <p id="16">1. generate your keypair: `openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048`</p>
    <p id="17">(the output file contains both the private and public key)</p>
    <p id="18">2. run python convertkey.py; it will convert the public key to C source code.</p>
    <p id="19">3. put the generated source code in</p>
    <p id="20">`content/nw/src/nw_content_verifier_delegate.cc`; replace the default key.</p>
    <p id="21">4. change the default value for the command line argument: change line no.73 in that file to:</p>
    <p id="22">   `Mode experiment_value =  ContentVerifierDelegate::ENFORCE_STRICT;`</p>
    <p id="23">5. build the NW binary.</p>
    <p id="24">Tools, sample application and the demo private key is under `tools/sign` directory. The demo private key is paired with the public key built into the official NW binaries.</p>
