    <p id="4">NW.js supports various build flavors for reducing the application size. Currently NW.js supports following build flavors:</p>
    <p id="5">* SDK flavor: has builtin support for DevTools and NaCl plugins. SDK flavor has the same capabilities as the builds before 0.13.0</p>
    <p id="6">* NaCL flavor: supports Native Client (NaCl) plugins, but has no builtin DevTools.</p>
    <p id="7">* Normal flavor: is a minimum build without DevTools and NaCl plugin support.</p>
    <p id="8">See [Build Flavors section in Building NW.js](../../For Developers/Building NW.js.md#build-flavors) for how to build them from source code.</p>
